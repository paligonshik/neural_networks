# Introduction to Neural Networks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for the assignments and projects completed as part of the course "Introduction to Neural Networks" within the [Andrew NG deep learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/]).

## Course Description

This course provides a broad introduction to neural networks and deep learning. I learnt  about the foundations of neural networks, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. You will also learn about the different types of neural networks, such as feedforward, convolutional, and recurrent neural networks. By the end of this course, you will have a good understanding of the concepts and techniques needed to build and train neural networks, and will be able to apply them to a wide range of applications.
